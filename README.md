Day-2 Notes
Print 
Input
print statement types

Custom words, Key words 

DataTypes
Variable?


Variable  ---> The one which can change or mutable one 
COnstant  ----> which cannot change Immutable

5

a  =  ?? 
c  = ??

Int ---> Integer
Float -- > Floating Value
Boolean  
String 


Integer --> whole Numbers (from 0 to infinite)  ----> int
Float ---> Numbers with deciamals		----> float
String ---> Text or characters			----> str
Boolean ---> True or False			----> bool


Print Statement ---> used to print a statement
syntax == print("write whatever you want in quotes only")

Input Statement
a = input("write a number")

def devi(a,b)
def
print
int
if
else
for
while
true
false


Day-3 Notes

if 
elif
else


if condition 

x =2 
if x=2 
then print as x is true 

elif x =3
 then print as x is false

else
value is wrong 


Operators
Arthemetic Operators  --->    +, -, *, ....

Comparision Operations  -----> <,>, ==, <=, >= ,!=

Logical Operators  ------>  AND, OR, NOT

AND

X     Y    X AND Y  &&
T     T      T
T     F      F
F     T      F
F     F      F


OR
X    Y    X OR Y  ||
T    T      T
T    F      T
F    T      T
F    F      F

NOT
X      ~X   !=
T	F
F	T


Comparision operators

a<b 2<3
a>b  3>2
a<=b  a can be less or eaqual to b but not greater than b
a>=b  a can be greater or equal to b but not less than b
a!=b  a can be anything but not b
a == b both are same
day _ 4 notes

Day_ 4 concepts --- > Loops

why we use loops means to repeat the tasks 

for 
while 


range --> function 

range (1,10, 2)

1 ---> start of range

10 ----> end of range

2 ----> step function 


range ( 10)

starting wil be 0 always 

step will be 1 as default 

for i in range(1,10)
	print (i)

loop controllers
 break ---> to stop the loop
 continue ---> to skip that current iteration and continue


While loop ---> conditioned based loop 

while condition :
 print


Day_5 ---> Lists and Tuples

List -- []
tuple --- ()

Lists are always mutable 
tuples are immutable 


anything which you want to store that can be changed in the future should be a list 

anything which you dint want to change in the future should be in a tuple

List Functions
append ---> to add an item at the end of the list
sort  ----> to sort the list
pop   ----> to remove an element form the list based on the index
remove ----> remove the last element

Tuple Functions
min 
max
count
len

Day_6---> Dictionaries & Sets

int
float
char
Boolean
tuple
list
string
Dict 
set 

Dictionary : {"key" :"value1", ...........}
set :{"key1","key2",.............}


Day 7 ---> Functions

predefied or user defined code blocks that are reusable and used by user in various aspects of his coding.

it starts "def" keyword 

Syntax:

def any_name_of_the_function(paramerters as required):
	code block


	return value

Day - 9 ----> String Functions 

Split() ----> any particular key value based divide the string 
strip()-----> to remove empty spaces 
replace() -----> to replace one word with another 
join() -----> to combine words after splitting 

Day - 10  ----> String formatting


print("")

print(f" {}")

print("hello .format.{}")

name = time
print("%s" %name)


Day -11 ---> list comprehensions

[expression for item in iterable if condition]

my_list = [x**2 for x in range(5)]


Day-14

Function	Purpose
 open()	        Opens a file
.read()	        Reads the whole file
.readline()	Reads one line at a time
.write()	Writes to a file
 with	        Used as a context manager
'r' / 'w' / 'a'	File modes: read / write

Day-15

CSV (Comma Separated Values)
Used for spreadsheets or tables

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
Used for structured data like dictionaries/lists


Module	Function
csv	csv.reader, csv.writer
json	json.load, json.dump

Day 16 & 17


CRUD ---> Create, Read, Update, Delete

What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
OOP is a programming paradigm where you structure code using objects and classes. It helps:

Reduce repetition

Improve modularity

Enhance reusability and scalability

What is a Class?
A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines:

Attributes (variables/data)

Methods (functions/actions)
class Dog:
    # This is a class
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

What is an Object?
An object is a specific instance of a class.
You create it using the class:
my_dog = Dog("Bruno", "Labrador")

The __init__() Method
A special method (constructor) that initializes object attributes when the object is created.

self refers to the current object.

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age


The self Keyword
Always the first parameter of instance methods.

Refers to the current object.

Used to access attributes and methods.

Instance Attributes
Defined in __init__()

Specific to each object

ðŸ”¹ Instance Methods
Functions defined inside the class

Use self to access attributes or call other methods

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius



Key Concepts Comparison

Concept			Description
class			Blueprint for objects
object			An instance of a class
__init__()		Constructor method
self			Reference to the current object
Instance Attribute	Variable tied to each object
Method			Function defined inside a class


What is a Constructor in Python?
A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the objectâ€™s properties (attributes).

 In Python, the constructor is the __init__() method.

Opposite of Constructor: Destructor
A destructor is a method that is called automatically when an object is deleted or destroyed, usually to clean up resources like files or network connections.

In Python, the destructor is the __del__() method.
