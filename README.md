print statement types

Custom words, Key words 

DataTypes
Variable?


Variable  ---> The one which can change or mutable one 
COnstant  ----> which cannot change Immutable

5

a  =  ?? 
c  = ??

Int ---> Integer
Float -- > Floating Value
Boolean  
String 


Integer --> whole Numbers (from 0 to infinite)  ----> int
Float ---> Numbers with deciamals		----> float
String ---> Text or characters			----> str
Boolean ---> True or False			----> bool


Print Statement ---> used to print a statement
syntax == print("write whatever you want in quotes only")

Input Statement
a = input("write a number")

def devi(a,b)
def
print
int
if
else
for
while
true
false


Day-3 Notes

if 
elif
else


if condition 

x =2 
if x=2 
then print as x is true 

elif x =3
 then print as x is false

else
value is wrong 


Operators
Arthemetic Operators  --->    +, -, *, ....

Comparision Operations  -----> <,>, ==, <=, >= ,!=

Logical Operators  ------>  AND, OR, NOT

AND

X     Y    X AND Y  &&
T     T      T
T     F      F
F     T      F
F     F      F


OR
X    Y    X OR Y  ||
T    T      T
T    F      T
F    T      T
F    F      F

NOT
X      ~X   !=
T	F
F	T


Comparision operators

a<b 2<3
a>b  3>2
a<=b  a can be less or eaqual to b but not greater than b
a>=b  a can be greater or equal to b but not less than b
a!=b  a can be anything but not b
a == b both are same

Day_ 4 concepts --- > Loops

why we use loops means to repeat the tasks 

for 
while 


range --> function 

range (1,10, 2)

1 ---> start of range

10 ----> end of range

2 ----> step function 


range ( 10)

starting wil be 0 always 

step will be 1 as default 

for i in range(1,10)
	print (i)

loop controllers
 break ---> to stop the loop
 continue ---> to skip that current iteration and continue


While loop ---> conditioned based loop 

while condition :
 print


Day_5 ---> Lists and Tuples

List -- []
tuple --- ()

Lists are always mutable 
tuples are immutable 


anything which you want to store that can be changed in the future should be a list 

anything which you dint want to change in the future should be in a tuple

List Functions
append ---> to add an item at the end of the list
sort  ----> to sort the list
pop   ----> to remove an element form the list based on the index
remove ----> remove the last element

Tuple Functions
min 
max
count
len
