 then print as x is false

else
value is wrong 


Operators
Arthemetic Operators  --->    +, -, *, ....

Comparision Operations  -----> <,>, ==, <=, >= ,!=

AND

X     Y    X AND Y  &&

T     F      F
F     T      F
F     F      F

day _ 4 notes

Day_ 4 concepts --- > Loops

why we use loops means to repeat the tasks 

for 
while 


range --> function 

range (1,10, 2)

1 ---> start of range

10 ----> end of range

2 ----> step function 


range ( 10)

starting wil be 0 always 

step will be 1 as default 

for i in range(1,10)
	print (i)

loop controllers
 break ---> to stop the loop
 continue ---> to skip that current iteration and continue


While loop ---> conditioned based loop 

while condition :
 print


Day_5 ---> Lists and Tuples

List -- []
tuple --- ()

Lists are always mutable 
tuples are immutable 


anything which you want to store that can be changed in the future should be a list 

anything which you dint want to change in the future should be in a tuple

List Functions
append ---> to add an item at the end of the list
sort  ----> to sort the list
pop   ----> to remove an element form the list based on the index
remove ----> remove the last element

Tuple Functions
min 
max
count
len

Day_6---> Dictionaries & Sets

int
float
char
Boolean
tuple
list
string
Dict 
set 

Dictionary : {"key" :"value1", ...........}
set :{"key1","key2",.............}


Day 7 ---> Functions

predefied or user defined code blocks that are reusable and used by user in various aspects of his coding.

it starts "def" keyword 

Syntax:

def any_name_of_the_function(paramerters as required):
	code block


	return value

Day - 9 ----> String Functions 

Split() ----> any particular key value based divide the string 
strip()-----> to remove empty spaces 
replace() -----> to replace one word with another 
join() -----> to combine words after splitting 

Day - 10  ----> String formatting


print("")

print(f" {}")

print("hello .format.{}")

name = time
print("%s" %name)


Day -11 ---> list comprehensions

[expression for item in iterable if condition]

my_list = [x**2 for x in range(5)]


Day-14

Function	Purpose
 open()	        Opens a file
.read()	        Reads the whole file
.readline()	Reads one line at a time
.write()	Writes to a file
 with	        Used as a context manager
'r' / 'w' / 'a'	File modes: read / write

Day-15

CSV (Comma Separated Values)
Used for spreadsheets or tables

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
Used for structured data like dictionaries/lists


Module	Function
csv	csv.reader, csv.writer
json	json.load, json.dump

Day 16 & 17


CRUD ---> Create, Read, Update, Delete

What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
OOP is a programming paradigm where you structure code using objects and classes. It helps:

Reduce repetition

Improve modularity

Enhance reusability and scalability

What is a Class?
A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines:

Attributes (variables/data)

Methods (functions/actions)
class Dog:
    # This is a class
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

What is an Object?
An object is a specific instance of a class.
You create it using the class:
my_dog = Dog("Bruno", "Labrador")

The __init__() Method
A special method (constructor) that initializes object attributes when the object is created.

self refers to the current object.

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age


The self Keyword
Always the first parameter of instance methods.

Refers to the current object.

Used to access attributes and methods.

Instance Attributes
Defined in __init__()

Specific to each object

üîπ Instance Methods
Functions defined inside the class

Use self to access attributes or call other methods

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius



Key Concepts Comparison

Concept			Description
class			Blueprint for objects
object			An instance of a class
__init__()		Constructor method
self			Reference to the current object
Instance Attribute	Variable tied to each object
Method			Function defined inside a class


What is a Constructor in Python?
A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object‚Äôs properties (attributes).

 In Python, the constructor is the __init__() method.

Opposite of Constructor: Destructor
A destructor is a method that is called automatically when an object is deleted or destroyed, usually to clean up resources like files or network connections.

In Python, the destructor is the __del__() method.


Day-18

What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent/base class).

‚úÖ Why Use Inheritance?
Reuse code

Maintain consistency across related classes

Add or extend features in child classes

class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet_child(self):
        print("Hello from Child")

obj = Child()
obj.greet()         # Inherited from Parent
obj.greet_child()   # From Child


What is super() in Python?
The super() function is used to call a method from a parent (or superclass) inside a child class.


Why use super()?
When a child class overrides a method from its parent class (like _init_() or attack()), you might still want to reuse part of the parent's method. Instead of rewriting the same code again, super() helps you reuse the parent‚Äôs functionality.


Day-19

Encapsulation & Private Variables

Encapsulation = Hiding internal data and showing only what is necessary through methods.

What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the OOP principle of binding data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class.
It also involves restricting direct access to some components of an object to protect the integrity of the data.

Why Encapsulation?
‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data

‚úÖ Makes code modular and easier to debug

‚úÖ Allows validation and control using getter/setter methods

‚úÖ Hides complexity from the user

Python Access Modifiers
Type	Syntax	Accessibility
Public	self.value	Accessible everywhere
Protected	self._value	Shouldn't be accessed outside the class
Private	self.__value	Name mangled, access limited to class only

Python doesn‚Äôt have real "private" ‚Äî it uses name mangling.

Access Modifiers in Python:

public: accessible everywhere (default)

_protected: conventionally internal use only

__private: name mangled, meant to be truly private


Real-Life Analogies
Real Life	Python Encapsulation
ATM card	Class
Card PIN	Private variable
Withdraw screen	Public method (withdraw)
Bank software	Encapsulated logic

Day_20

What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means "many forms".
In programming, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, while still calling their specific implementations.

üîÅ In Python, this often happens through method overriding and duck typing (if it walks like a duck...).


Key Concepts
Concept	Description
Polymorphism	Different classes implement the same method differently
Method Overriding	Subclass redefines a method from the parent class
Duck Typing	Python relies on method names and behavior rather than strict types

Real-World Analogy
Situation	Polymorphism Example
Payment systems	.pay() might work differently in UPI, credit card, or PayPal classes
UI Components	.draw() can differ for buttons, sliders, checkboxes
File Readers	.read() method works for CSV, JSON, or TXT readers
